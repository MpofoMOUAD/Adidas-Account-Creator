Adidas account creator for UK/US with captcha bypass.

**Must have Python 3 to run this script.**

**ONLY CHANGE THE CONFIG.JSON NOT ANYTHING IN THE SCRIPT!**

How to run:

- Download repo.
- Install requests if it already isn't satisfied. (type "pip install requests" into terminal)
- Edit config.json to have your chosen credentials (name etc.) 
- Open terminal (command prompt)
- cd to file location or open terminal in the folder the script it in.
- Type "python account.py" or "python3 account.py" depending on your python versions.

If you want accounts for Adidas US, change the "base_url" in the script from ".co.uk" to ".com" manually.

Don’t create an “Accounts.txt” file, the script will do that itself.

Get accounts from "Accounts.txt" and enjoy!
